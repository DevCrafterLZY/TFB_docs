Introduction
============

TFB is an open-source library designed for time series forecasting researchers.

We provide a clean codebase for end-to-end evaluation of time series forecasting models, comparing their performance with baseline algorithms under various evaluation strategies and metrics.

The below figure provides a visual overview of TFBâ€™s pipeline. You can access the source code on `GitHub <https://github.com/decisionintelligence/TFB>`_ and read our paper on `arXiv <https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20150>`_. Additionally, We have created a leaderboard for time series forecasting, which can be accessed by clicking `here <https://decisionintelligence.github.io/OpenTS/>`_.
